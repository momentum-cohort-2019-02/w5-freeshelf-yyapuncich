Learn Ruby the Hard Way,Zed Shaw,Ruby,"This simple book is meant to get you started in programming. The title says it's the hard way to learn to write code, but it's actually not. It's only the ""hard"" way because it uses a technique called instruction. Instruction is where I tell you to do a sequence of controlled exercises designed to build a skill through repetition. This technique works very well with beginners who know nothing and need to acquire basic skills before they can understand more complex topics. It's used in everything from martial arts to music to even basic math and reading skills.",https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/,2018-12-14

Intro to the React Framework,Pavan Podila,JavaScript,"In today's world of Javascript Application frameworks, design philosophy is the key differentiating factor. If you compare the popular JS frameworks, such as EmberJS, AngularJS, Backbone, Knockout, etc. you are sure to find differences in their abstractions, thinking models, and of course the terminology. This is a direct consequence of the underlying design philosophy. But, in principle, they all do one thing, which is to abstract out the DOM in such a way that you don't deal directly with HTML Elements.",https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/intro-to-the-react-framework--net-35660,2019-01-01

A Guide to Python's Magic Methods,Rafe Kettler,Python,"This guide is the culmination of a few months' worth of blog posts. The subject is magic methods.

What are magic methods? They're everything in object-oriented Python. They're special methods that you can define to add ""magic"" to your classes. They're always surrounded by double underscores (e.g. __init__ or __lt__). They're also not as well documented as they need to be. All of the magic methods for Python appear in the same section in the Python docs, but they're scattered about and only loosely organized. There's hardly an example to be found in that section (and that may very well be by design, since they're all detailed in the language reference, along with boring syntax descriptions, etc.).",https://github.com/RafeKettler/magicmethods,2018-03-15
Data Structures and Algorithms in Python,B. R. Preiss,Python,"This book is about the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms--the basic elements from which large and complex software artifacts are built. To develop a solid understanding of a data structure requires three things: First, you must learn how the information is arranged in the memory of the computer. Second, you must become familiar with the algorithms for manipulating the information contained in the data structure. And third, you must understand the performance characteristics of the data structure so that when called upon to select a suitable data structure for a particular application, you are able to make an appropriate decision.

This book also illustrates object-oriented design and it promotes the use of common, object-oriented design patterns. The algorithms and data structures in the book are presented in the Python programming language. Virtually all the data structures are presented in the context of a single class hierarchy. This commitment to a single design allows the programs presented in the later chapters to build upon the programs presented in the earlier chapters.",https://web.archive.org/web/20161016153130/http://www.brpreiss.com/books/opus7/html/book.html,2018-03-16
